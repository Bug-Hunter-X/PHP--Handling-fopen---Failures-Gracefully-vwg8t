```php
$file = fopen("myfile.txt", "r+");
if ($file) {
    // ... process the file ...
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle the error appropriately, e.g., log it, display a message
    error_log("Error opening file: myfile.txt");
}
```
This improved version explicitly checks if `fopen()` returned a valid file pointer before attempting to close it.  It also includes error handling to manage the case where `fopen()` fails.
