```php
$file = fopen("myfile.txt", "r+");
if ($file) {
    // ... process the file ...
    fclose($file);
}
```
This code has a potential issue. If `fopen()` fails (e.g., the file doesn't exist or is not readable),  `$file` will be `false`.  The code then proceeds to use `fclose($file)` on a `false` value. While PHP handles this gracefully without a fatal error, it's inefficient and can mask other issues.  The `fclose` function only needs to be called if the `fopen` function was successful and returned a valid file pointer.
